II.	Project Summary

The Police Accountability Task Force was created by Katherine, Dick, and volunteer undergraduate students to analyze datasets and determine police outliers responsible for racial disparities in ticketing, use of force, and police shootings. It intends to work towards increasing awareness of who “bad apples” are and establishing criteria for removing officers who are routinely disparate in their policing behavior.

A.	Scope

The Task Force is focused on several police departments. To start, the Task Force will focus on 5 different police precincts. 

III.	Goals

Develop a system for determining which officers in a given police precinct drive racial disparities in policing by:

•	Establishing department-level disparities in ticketing, use of force, and officer involved shootings

•	Determining which officers represent outliers in ticketing disparities, and what percent of these disparities they account for

•	Applying the strategy for determining highly disparate officers to officer use of force and officer involved shootings

•	Give department-level recommendations to police departments for officers who should be fired or disciplined, and estimate reduction in disparities based on following these 
recommendations.

IV.	Work Streams

A.	Data consolidation and cleaning

•	Submit FOIA requests for needed missing data

•	Remove NAs

•	Standardize data

B.	Join analysis

•	Determine whether datasets can be linked based on existing data

C.	Data visualization

•	Histograms

•	Outliers

•	Clusters

•	Categorizations

D.	Officer and district disparities analysis – citations

•	District disparity score

•	Identify officers that are driving the disparity score

•	Confirm that these officers drive disparity score statistically

E.	Officer and district disparities analysis – use of force

•	District disparity score

•	Identify officers that are driving the disparity score

•	Confirm that these officers drive disparity score statistically

F.	Officer and district disparities analysis – officer involved shooting

•	District disparity score

•	Identify officers that are driving the disparity score

•	Allude that identified officers drive the disparity score based on citations and use of force analyses





V.	Measures of Success

A.	Officers in each department are identified as particularly responsible for the disparities

B.	Correlation between disparate behavior on citations, use of force, and officer involved shooting

C.	Concrete recommendations made for which officers should be fired

D.	We all learn something about coding!



VI.	Performance Indicators

A.	FOIA request submitted

B.	Data is cleaned

C.	Data can be joined

D.	Data is visualized

E.	Citations disparities analyzed

F.	Use of force disparities analyzed

G.	Officer involved shooting disparities analyzed



VII.	Taskforce Structure



A.	Committee

Committee is to consist of 6-8 members, majority undergraduate RAs or postbacs,

1.	Membership

Interested students will be permitted to join contingent upon space in the committee. If choices need to be made among multiple interested parties decisions will be made based on equity and inclusion. If a committee member misses more than 1 meeting without forewarning, the committee will discuss their retention on the committee.

2.	Decision Making

Decisions will be made by Katherine. All members can propose ideas either individually or in group meetings, but Katherine has the final say about big-picture issues. Individual coders will be empowered to make their own decisions about how to complete their assigned coding tasks. 

3.	Setting the Agenda

Agendas will be set within the first 5 minutes of each meeting by asking members who has updates or by Katherine setting an agenda. 

4.	Meeting Manager

Katherine will act as meeting manager unless another member has a particular need to do so. 

5.	Work Review Process

If the task force must review any materials, the creator will be expected to share their drafts at least 3 days before a committee meetings, and other members will be expected to have reviewed the drafts before the meeting. Material will be reviewed point by point, feedback given, and Katherine will decide on final decisions.
New items will be presented for 5-10 minutes by the creator, with no questions from the committee. A 5-10 minute QA will be available after, only for clarifications, not for proposals or changes. Then a line by line committee review can begin.
